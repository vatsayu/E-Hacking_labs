# Hacking_labs
üîç A comprehensive repository for all my hacking lab activities, experiments, and write-ups.
 This repository serves as a centralized hub for documenting my hands-on labs, security research, and ethical hacking exercises. Here, you‚Äôll find:

 ‚Ä¢ Lab reports and step-by-step walkthroughs of vulnerabilities, exploits, and defensive techniques.

 ‚Ä¢ Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts for testing security flaws in controlled environments.

 ‚Ä¢ Write-ups on CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges, penetration testing, and cybersecurity tools.


 Notes and resources on topics like:

  
   ‚Ä¢ Network scanning and enumeration.

   ‚Ä¢ Web application security (OWASP Top 10).

   ‚Ä¢ Reverse engineering and malware analysis.

   ‚Ä¢ Privilege escalation and post-exploitation techniques.

   ‚Ä¢ Forensic analysis and incident response.

üìå Key Features of This Repository


Ethical Focus:
All activities and labs are conducted in controlled, legal environments (e.g., virtual machines, CTF platforms, or authorized labs). This repository is for educational and research purposes only.


Hands-On Learning:
Each lab includes:

Objectives: What you aim to achieve.
Methodology: Step-by-step instructions.
Findings: Results, screenshots, and analysis.
Mitigations: How to patch or defend against the vulnerability.



Open Collaboration:

Feel free to fork this repository, suggest improvements, or contribute your own labs.
Submit pull requests for corrections, additional labs, or better explanations.



# Tools and Environments:

Kali Linux, Parrot OS, and BlackArch for offensive security.
VirtualBox/VMware for isolated lab environments.
Docker for containerized vulnerable applications (e.g., DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop).
